Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial.
Gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient,
rumor-shadowed manor. Fattened by decadence and luxury. And yet, I began to tire of
conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a
gateway to some fabulous and unnamable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort
towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained
of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked
crags beneath the lowest foundations we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.
Our every step unsettled the ancient earth but we were in a realm of death and madness! In
the end, I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity.
Until consciousness failed me. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is
a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright, and deliver our family
from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.
